# Algorithmic Complexity

Understanding the efficiency of algorithms is key for performance optimization.

### Big O Notation Example

The time complexity for searching an element in a sorted array using binary search is logarithmic:

$$ O(\log n) $$

Contrast this with a linear search, which has a complexity of:

$$ O(n) $$

Where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.
